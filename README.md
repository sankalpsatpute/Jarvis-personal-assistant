Jarvis_AI
This is my attempt at building a not so much of an AI, Jarvis

About
This .py script uses Google Calendar API to recieve info about calendar and then uses pyttsx3, an offline speech library to convey results and understand speech.

Disclaimer
This is NOT an Artificial Intelligence, I have used conditionals to find, If a particular phrase exists in the speech, and then deliver particular results based on that.

BUGS
Yes, There is a miniscule bug that doesn't allow the program to run properly, and I am unable to debug it. Really Encourage anyone to try to debug and then send a pull request, will be very helpful.
